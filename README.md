**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.


**Description of technologies used**
1. HTML5
2. CSS3

| Properties | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ```css  grid-template-columns: ``` | ```css  repeat( auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); ```| To achieve wrapping, we can use the **auto-fit**.  So we need to start by specifying a minimum width for the columns, making sure they donâ€™t get too narrow. We can do that using the **minmax()** function.|
